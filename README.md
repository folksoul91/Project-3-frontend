## User Story

---

As a consumer, I am constantly struggling to find new shoe products that are unique. Funky Shoes keeps me up to date with new shoes that are fun and not a clone of previous models.

## Getting Started

Navigate throughout the page. Add items to the cart by clicking on the "ADD TO CART" button. If you no longer wish to purchase the items you had selected, simply click on the cart button from the header and click the trash can logo.
